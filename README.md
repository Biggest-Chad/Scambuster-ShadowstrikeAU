Extension addon provided by [discord.gg/golemagg](https://discord.gg/golemagg) for [Scambuster](https://github.com/hypernormalisation/Scambuster), packaging information\
on scammers and scam histories into [Scambuster](https://github.com/hypernormalisation/Scambuster), to protect players in-game.

## Getting Started

This addon packages realm data on scammers to be used with the [Scambuster](https://github.com/hypernormalisation/Scambuster) addon framework.
As such, it requires both addons to work. Once you install Scambuster Golemagg alongside Scambuster, the game will alert you in real-time whenever you encounter a scammer.
To access the configuration options type `/scambuster` into the chat panel or open it via the interface addon menu.
